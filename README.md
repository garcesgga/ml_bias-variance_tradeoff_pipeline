Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the data patterns, while overfitting happens when a model is too complex and learns noise instead of general trends.  
Regularization techniques, such as Ridge regression, help balance bias and variance to improve generalization.

# Bias-Variance Tradeoff Pipeline
This notebook project demonstrates a **complete machine learning pipeline** to address underfitting and overfitting using polynomial regression and Ridge regularization.  
The workflow covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different approaches.

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.12  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib
